## Project Overview

In this project, we perform sentiment analysis on an article to extract a concise summary. The main tasks include:
1. Cleaning and preparing the data.
2. Calculating sentiment scores using tokens and lemmas.
3. Filtering and selecting relevant sentences for the summary.
4. Evaluating the sentiment and structural aspects of the summary.

## File Details

- **article.html**: The raw HTML file containing the article content.
- **article-summarizer.ipynb**: The final summarized version of the article.
